# ⛔️ DEPRECATED Sound.xyz subgraph

Current subgraph here: https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/schmidsi/sound-subgraph?query=Example%20query

## Spec

Sound.xyz deploys for every artist its own ERC721 (or ERC1155?) contract from a factory contract. The artist contract is a [BeaconProxy](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy). There are multiple drops (tracks) per artist. Each track has one (to be confirmed) price and can be sold a limited amount of times. Usually 25, but this is probably also determined in the contract.

This subgraph should track following events:

- Creation of new artist contract (use data source templates)
  - Token Symbol
  - Name
  - Metadata
- New drop on artist contract: 
  - As soon as it is registered
  - Start time
  - Amount of items
  - Price
- Sale events on artist contract, during drop inclusive price
- Transfer events of NFTs
- Statistics (Prio 2):
  - Total NFTs sold
  - Total contracts deployed
  - Total drops
